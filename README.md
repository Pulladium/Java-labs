# Java Labs 2-5

This repository contains my implementations for Labs 2-5. Each lab focuses on different programming concepts and tasks.

## Lab 02 - Sequence Statistics

Calculate the average value and standard deviation from a sequence of numbers provided via standard input. The program processes every 10 numbers and outputs the statistics, handling non-numeric values and end-of-input detection.

## Lab 03 - Circular Queue

Implement a circular queue to store `String` values with a specified capacity. The queue supports standard operations like enqueue and dequeue, ensuring efficient use of space with a circular array.

## Lab 04 - Password Cracking

Develop a brute force attack algorithm to crack a password of a given length using recursion. The algorithm tests all possible character combinations until the correct password is found.

## Lab 05 - Binary Tree

Implement a binary tree using provided interfaces. The tree is constructed from an array of integers, with methods to set the tree, get the root, and provide a string representation of the tree structure.
